# Employee Polls Project

This is final assessment for the Udacity React Nanodegree.

The project is specifically thought in order to put in practise the react-redux and the react-router-dom skills learnt throughout the course.

It consists of a WebApp by which the user can 
- answer to several polls created by other users;
- upon giving his vote, the user can then read som stats about that particolar poll;
- create his own poll.


## To start the project
Just run ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` in this very order. Enjoy ;)
